## Project Motivations
Automated surveillance systems called camera traps have helped conservationists study and monitor a wide range of ecologies while limiting human interference. Camera traps are triggered by motion or heat, and passively record the behavior of species in the area without significantly disturbing their natural tendencies.

However, camera traps also generate a vast amount of data that quickly exceeds the capacity of humans to sift through. That's where machine learning can help! Advances in computer vision can help automate tasks like species detection and classification, localization, depth estimation, and individual identification so humans can more effectively learn from and protect these ecologies. The objective of the project is to explore the transfer learning technique through convoluted neural network to detect and classify different class of animals.
